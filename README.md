----

## Project Overview:

This analysis was conducted to research:

- which platform provides the best quality of film on average;

- which genres have brought the most success over a 20 year period;

- which platform's films have the most diverse range of countries of origin;

- which platform hosts the most profitable films?

Using TMDb and IMDb, a dataset of movies released after 2000 was prepared. These movies were specified to be on Netflix, Stan, and Amazon Prime.

## Project Objectives:

1. Retrieve dataset for movies from 2000-2023 with information on their availability on three streaming platforms: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Stan.  

2. Perform data clean-up, filter and formatting for a standardised master dataset.  

3. Create visualizations for data analysis of the following:  

	a. Overview of movies available from the source. 
	
	b. Distribution of genres, ratings and budget per group year(5 year increments). 
	
	c. Comparison of movies across three streaming platforms: audience rating, runtime, country proudction, etc.
